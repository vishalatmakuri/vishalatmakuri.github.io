                    <p>Surprisingly I was able to complete the algorithm that solved the queens problem. With 3 hours to spare. It was a fun challenge to complete. The extra time gave me some research opportunity to figure out how the problem can be solved using bitwise operators.</p>

                <div class="row"><p><b>Qweens problem March 11</b></p>
                    <p>Today was the start of the fun but difficult NQweens. Place as N queens on a NxN board with out them falling on each others attack path. Im sure there are better styles of algorithms out there but its always good to work it out form scratch so I plan to go using the brute force style. From N=1-9. So far We were able to create a few helper functions to figure out if there were any intersections if a queen was placed on the board. But before moving on to queens maybe a simpler problem can be solved. So by trying to figure out N rooks. So far i think the sofware is working but something is bugging out after size of 4 . Hopefully sould be able to solve it tomorrw.</p>
